# Introduction

Embeddings are a powerful technique for representing data in a continuous vector space, preserving semantic relationships between items. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for working with embeddings, including the creation of embeddings for various data types and the development of a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval.

# Features

    1) Embedding Generation: Implement and experiment with state-of-the-art techniques for generating embeddings from different types of data, including text, images, and more.

    2) Vector Database: Create and manage a vector database that enables fast and efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of vector representations.

    Example Implementations: Explore example implementations demonstrating the use of embeddings and vector databases in real-world scenarios.

# Usage

The repository provides a set of tools and modules for working with embeddings and vector databases.
